# KaggleScripts

The latest real competition that I worked on was: <i>Grupo Bimbo Inventory Demand</i>

Note that the practice competition <i>Titanic Survivors'</i> highest scorers overfit to the dataset, thus achieving accuracies of even 100%. I have tried to avoid overfitting techniques. Also, there are more things to do to improve this script. I am simply supplying the script as-is from the 2nd time I looked at the problem closely, though I know of at least one or two ways to improve it.

Note that the practice competition <i>Animal Shelters'</i> highest scorers all trained their data on an external data set and thus had better models.
The approach I've used is pretty messy too with lots of variables, but since it was a practice competition I didn't go back to it. Similar to the Titanic script, this script is also fairly unchanged although a fair amount of work can to be done to improve it more.
